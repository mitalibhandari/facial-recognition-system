# Facial Recognition System Using Python

**Libraries Used:** face_recognition, OpenCV, OS

- I have used _OpenCV_ for labelling on the images and _OS_ for working with the directories.
- I have created two directories, known_faces and unknown_faces. Inside known_faces I have added three images of elon musk and in unknown_faces, I have added images I intend to label.
- I added following images in the Known_directory
  ![Elon Musk](elon_mush2.jpeg)
